Allow you to add multiple domains and set different wp_options, home page, favicon, scripts and more, for each domain.

== Description ==

A *very simple plugin* that fits a *very simple purpose*:
Add multiple domains in a single WordPress (simple) installation and point each domain to a specific page.

Most common use case for this plugin is to create a bunch of landing pages, with different domains, without any relationship between the pages. But in a single and simple WordPress admin panel. It's most recommended for single page websites, and create multi pages websites with different domains may be a little tricky, even if it's possible (and it is).

It is a masterpiece when combined with a powerfull page builder such as *elementor*. And allows you to do a single activation of premium plugins, like *elementor pro*, since you will manage all pages from a single admin panel, registered in your main domain.

Notice that this is absolute different from *WordPress MultiSite* built-in feature. There will not be created isolated enviroments for each site, so all activated plugins and themes will potentially affect all pages from all domains included with this plugin.

If you need to build complex different websites, with multiple pages, in multiple domains, usind different plugins and themes i would recommend you to use WordPress Multisite installation or even isolated WordPress installations.

What you will be able to do with this plugin:
* Add multiple domains to a single WordPress installation;
* Point each domain to a specific home page;
* Configure different WordPress general options for each domain. For example, site name, logo, favicon...;
* Add custom scripts and styles for each domain, that will not affect other domains included. For example, Google Analytics tag;
* Restrict any page to a single domain, so it cannot be accessed acidently in wrong domains.

1. Download this plugin zip file;
